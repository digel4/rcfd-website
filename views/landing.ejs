						<p>
							We are sorry to announce in the current circumstances, all face-to-face Big House events and mentoring up until the end of April have been postponed. All partners are working to move events online where possible - scroll down to see which events are still going ahead in a digital capacity. We will keep a close eye on the developing situation and make a decision regarding the set-up for our events from May onwards in due course. We will continue to support creative and digital businesses and entrepreneurs online and over the phone wherever we can. Please keep an eye on Big House website, emails and social media for updates as we have them. Individual partners will supply further details as their revised offers become available.
